			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

#define WORD_ALIGN 4
Used to align the stack after pushing tokens to a multiple of 4. This allows reading
the stack to be easier. 

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?  Is it enough to limit
>> the size of the incoming commandline?  Why or Why not?

We arranged to order of argv[] by storing the tokens into argv[] in the 
reverse order without decrementing *esp. Then we iterate through argv[] from
argc - 1 to 0 where we decrement the *esp, memcpy the token and set argv[i] (i 
is the index we are on) to *esp. 

We avoided overflowing the stack by setting a limit on the command line through 
making argv support command lines of up to 128 characters. If the whole command line
can only be up to 128 characters, let the file name and all following arguments be 
one character. This means there is at most 64 tokens in the commandline, thus it will
take 128 bytes from length of token + null char. Each token will have its own 
pointer which takes up a total of 512 bytes. In this scenario, the total memory size
stored is about 800 bytes, which is is enough to limit the max command line without
risking overflowing the stack.  

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok_r is reentrant code that takes in the extra save_ptr code in order to
parse the file name out of the command line to open the file in the filesys in 
the load function of process.c. Pintos chose to implement this version because it
allows for the save_ptr to allow it to work with multi-threaded code. 

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

1. Allows for higher abstraction. We can assign semantics to each code section such
as the executable name to argv[0]. This allows for easier access to the arguments
by going to argv[0] rather than looking through the command line. 

2. Easier to get onto the stack and arrange it.  

			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In thread.h:
struct list children - list of child processes for the thread.
struct list files - list of process_files for this particular thread, closing the file
removes the file from the list. 
struct list_elem child_elem - list_elem for the children list
struct process_file *pf - currently opened process file for the thread. 

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B10: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future semesters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future semesters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future semesters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
