1. Virtual address is the address of the whole system while physical address is the 
referenced address + PHYS_BASE

2. 

Paging prevents external fragmentation 
Processes can be run while only partially being loaded into main memory. 

3. 

resident bit - page is not in resident with the memory, not in any frames. 
dirty bit - indicates if the page has been modified since read. 
reference bit - indicates when the paging has been read/referenced. 

4. 

If the assumed vm system uses paging, then it is not vulnerable to external fragmentation. 
Paging can lead to internal fragmentation as the pages are not stored in contiguous memory.  

5. 

Page faults are caused by when a page is referenced but not in main memory. 
The end result of the faulting process is that it gets restarted.
