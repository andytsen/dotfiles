"In the first that died was sister Jane; // woman

"But they are dead; those two are dead! // Man

    The difference in speaking style between the man and the young maid includes the tone, ideas, and
diction while they share in syntax of dialogue. 
    For differences, the beginning of the poem establishes that the man believes that the young girl does not know anything about death as she is immature. He talks in a disdainful and, later on, bewildered tone. For example, in the final stanza, the man repeats "But they are dead; those two are dead",referring to emphasis that the girl's two siblings are dead and questions why she is able to take it so well as she plays with her brother's grave (line 55). Contrastly, the girl speaks in a positive and resistant tone. She is firm in her position that her siblings still exist and the final line in thepoem amplifies this with her quote. 
    Ideas parallel this difference in the speaking style of the two characters. The man simply thinks that the girl is naive and does not understand that people who die are no longer with her. He continues to question her and tell her about what connections she has towards them, maybe inferring that her ability to resist grief is the lack of closeness with the two dead siblings. The girl speaks about her belief that she can still interact and cherish their existence despite death. 
    The choice of words between the two characters also differs. The girl calls the man "Sir" and uses rather simple words to tell her story. The man has more aggressive phrases and the punctuation used by Wordsworth emphasizes this. The girl is more calm but firm on her beliefs with words like "Nay" and  "O! Master. We are seven".
    Similarties come from the syntax of the dialogue. The first comes with the swapping of objects with subjects. In line 41, the girl says "My stockings there I often knit" and "My kerchief there I hem". The man also does some swapping in "Their graves are green, they may be seen". These two share the similarities to the grammar in Latin.
