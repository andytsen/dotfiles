Marxian Democracy

1. Basic Assumptions

    a. Economics as the "Base" of politics, 

    Liberals attempt to limit excess of sovereignty which is why they 
    like representation. Allows for representatives to make the 
    decisions, which many other forms of Democracy are skeptical of. 
    
    Ancient Athens again has the almost perfect form of Direct 
    democracy. Thanks to small city state and small amount of citizens
    Allows for logistics to be easier to handle. j

    Karl Marx - had some contributions that had some good ideas
    and bad ideas. He challenged the liberal democracy and 
    bases on capitalism and deal with free market. Obviously
    Marxian democracy regulates economics and other things. He says 
    that he sees free market in a different way in the minimum wage, 
    exploitation, and many other things. Fundamental equality within
    the free market is impossible. Sees difference in economy as 
    a result of business and free market. 

    b. Exploitation is inherent in Capitalism 
    Again the business owners who own factories and many workers. 
    Workers have very little money and power in comparison. Suddenly
    inequality within economy within the times. Business sets the terms
    and controls the wages of the factories. Inequality leads to
    the capital owners and business owners under Marxian. 
    
2. Problems of Representative Democracy

    a) Capitalism leads to inequality in economy. 

    Belief that equality will have perfect freedom and allow for 
    the banishment of economic inequality. People thought it was 
    a great idea. Means of production -> allows for the stable 
    production. This leads to no means of innovations. Business class
    owns these productions and are extremely rich. Large majority 
    do no own anythign.

    b) Mechanism of predominant business influence

    c) Denying effective citizenship & participation to workers. 
        Business workers can prevent people from electing for 
        political representation and positions. 

3. The Call for Revolution 

    a) Why revolution is necessary in Marx's Eyes
    
        Workers are bossed around. Casting votes sucks and doesn't
        really help thanks to the point in 2c. Seems utopian but
        unrealistic.  

    b) How revolution will come about, in Marx's view. 
    
        How revolutions will look good is by redistributing wealth.
        Marx was a huge critic of capitalism.  
    
    c) Expected results of Revolution: A Classless, Conflicting-Free 
       and Eventually Stateless Society. 
        
        Leads to a increase in affluence, but poor distribution of it.
        Destroy the classes and allows for fighting among classes. 
        Marxian abolishes the concept of private property and sees
        capitalism as something that will eventually lead to the revo-
        lution of classes. 

        In marxian terms, industrial shoe companies have destroyed
        artisans. Capitalists have driven lower classes and taken
        away their private property and have led them to become
        working classes. 

        Late capitalism created such a large working class that 
        the deleting and revolting is made easy. Socialism appropriates
        the little remaining of the business class and pushes history
        furhter. 

4.  Direct Democracy a la Marx

    a) Council System: Direct Democracy at a Large Scale
       
        People who are in the council become detatched from the base.
        Marxian council system goes for very frequent rotation prevents
        this from happening. The representatives leads to council and
        allows effective decision making thanks to frequent rotation. 
        People get what they want more likely and are more successful. 

    b) Delegates (Council Systems) vs Representatives
