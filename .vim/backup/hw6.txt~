1. 

    a)  2^8 bytes
    b)  4608 Bytes  

2. 
    Internal fragmentation is when the pages of the process are fragmented and not
    loaded from the disk correctly. 

    Ways to prevent internal fragmentation:
        Forward mapped page tables
        Multi-level page tables
        Inverted page tables

3.
    a. 10 bits
    b. 4 bits
    c. 12 bits
    d. 4096 bytes
4.

     I would disagree with this design as retrieving the code text is the same
    as paging and grabbing page frames from the disk space. This makes the swap area 
    just as expensive. 

5. 
    a. Faults 3 times for 3 frames but 7 times for 4 frames
    b.
