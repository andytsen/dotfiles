## Guide

Go to the repo directory and run:

```
sh install.sh
```

Your old vim setup will be deleted

I advise to look at the installation script before running it. 

Later on, I plan on putting user's old vim set up 
in a different folder. Along with a restoration 
script. 

Plugins used:

**Nerdtree**: File navigation plugin 
**Syntastic**: Syntax checker common programming languages 
**vim-airline**: Vim-airline that shows important information.
